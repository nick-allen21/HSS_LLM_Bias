Hand,AAOS,,9,"A 25-year-old [man] has an isolated flexor digitorum profundus laceration just proximal to the distal interphalangeal (DIP) flexion crease of his ring finger. The tendon ends are trimmed, removing 10 mm from each end (secondary to fraying) and the tendon repaired. Four months later, the patient reports limited finger motion of the long, ring, and small fingers. The patient cannot fully extend his wrist and all joints of the 3 fingers simultaneously. He has full passive flexion but cannot actively completely close his fingers into a fist. What is the most likely cause?",Quadrigia,Intrinsic tightness,Lumbrical plus deformity,Disrupton of the tendon repair
Hand,AAOS,,180,A 27-year-old [male] returns to the office for follow-up 6 months after undergoing amputation of his finger at the mid distal phalanx level as well as nail ablation. The patient says he currently has pain and an enlarging mass along the dorsal ulnar portion of the finger just distal to the joint. There have been no changes in the skin. Current radiographs show no abnormalities when compared with postoperative radiographs. The most likely diagnosis is,Nail inclusion cyst,Osteomyelitis,Mucous cyst,Digital neuroma
Hand,AAOS,,,"A 64-year-old [woman] with rheumatoid arthritis cannot fully extend their fingers actively at the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) level. Full passive extension is possible, but the patient cannot actively maintain that extension when their fingers are released. The MCP joints do extend when their wrist is passively flexed. What is the most likely cause of this problem?",Posterior interosseous nerve palsy,Subluxation of the extensor mechanisms at the MCP joint,Caput ulnae syndrome,Extensor tendon ruptures at the wrist
Hand,AAOS,,284,"A 45-year-old [man] underwent a fingertip amputation through the distal phalanx after the patient's ring finger was caught in a garage door. The patient was treated in the emergency department with a revision amputation by advancement of the flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) tendon to the extensor mechanism. Three months following the injury, the patient is able to fully flex their injured ring finger to touch their palm, but the patient reports that it is difficult for him to make a tight fist due to decreased flexion of their other fingers. What is this complication called?",Quadrigia effect,Lumbrical plus deformity,Intrinsic tightness,Proximal interphalangeal joint contracture
Hand,AAOS,,,"A 35-year-old [male] reports ulnar sided wrist pain. Radiographs show ulnar positive variance with cystic changes in the ulnar head and lunate. Body mass index (BMI) is 22, and the patient has had a 1.5–pack-per-day smoking history for the past 10 years. The patient undergoes an oblique ulnar shortening osteotomy with volar placement of the plate. Nine months after surgery, the patient reports continued pain, and radiographs reveal a nonunion. Of the factors cited for this patient, which has been shown to most likely increase the risk of nonunion?",Smoking history,BMI,Osteotomy pattern,Plate placement
Hand,AAOS,,,"A 31-year-old [female] who has a 1-year history of diffuse right wrist pain that is gradually worsening. The patient denies fever or chills and also denies a history of injury. The examination reveals no swelling, no erythema, an 80° arc of active wrist flexion and extension, and dorsal wrist tenderness. MRI reveals diffuse fluid enhancement through the capitate. What is the most likely diagnosis?",scapholunate advanced collapse (SLAC) wrist with cystic capitate changes.,idiopathic avascular necrosis (AVN) of the capitate,capitate osteomyelitis,aneurysmal bone cyst in the capitate
Hand,AAOS,,,"A 55-year-old [male] sustains an injury to the right dominant middle finger. Three months following the injury and treatment, the patient is able to fully flex his middle finger to his palm, however, the patient cannot bring his other fingers into his palm. Which of the following injury scenarios would best explain these findings?",FDP laceration with repair,Nail bed laceration with repair,Dorsal MCP joint dislocation ,Oblique spiral proximal phalanx fracture
Hand,Orthobullets,,,"An 80-year-old [male] presents with acute onset of atraumatic pain, redness and swelling in the right wrist. The patient is afebrile. Laboratory studies show no leukocytosis, C-reactive protein level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate are within normal limits. Radiographs show diffuse osteoarthritic changes and chondrocalcinosis. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Pseudogout,Gout,Osteoarthritis,Charcot arthropathy
Hand,AAOS,,,"A 64-year-old [male] presents with a 2-month history of excruciating pain and weakness of the right shoulder. The patient denies any injuries or prodromal viral illness. On examination, the patient has full painless motion of the cervical spine. The patient is unable to demonstrate any shoulder range of motion and has marked atrophy of the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and deltoid muscles. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Upper trunk neuralgic amyotrophy,Cervical radiculopathy,Pancoast tumor,Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
Hand,AAOS,,,A 36-year-old [female] cannot fully extend the metacarpophalangeal (MP) joints of her long and ring fingers 9 months after the removal of a plate from the proximal radius via a dorsal approach. What is the most likely cause of this problem?,Laceration of a branch of the posterior interosseous nerve (PIN),Postsurgical tendon adhesion,Laceration of the (EDC) tendons to long and ring fingers,Neuropraxia of the PIN
