Hand,AAOS,,,59,"A 17-year-old [boy] with left spastic hemiplegia secondary to cerebral palsy is being evaluated for persistent swan neck deformities of the affected hand. Splinting has been tried with some improvement, but the patient does not want to wear the splints any more. On physical examination, the patient demonstrates full extension of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints, 30° of hyperextension of the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints, and flexion of the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints when the patient attempts to actively extend their digits. The patient is able to initiate flexion at the PIP joints with his MCP joints held in neutral extension. The patient has equal PIP flexion when the MCP joints are extended and flexed. What is the most appropriate surgical treatment to address his swan neck deformity?",Central slip tenotomy,Terminal tendon release,Dorsal rerouting of the lateral bands,Intrinsic lengthening
Hand,AAOS,,,89,"A 54-year-old [] carpenter presents with a 12-month history of pain and dysesthesias at the right small and ring fingers. The patient denies tobacco use. Ulcerations have intermittently appeared at the tips of these digits. Minimal improvement is reported after the use of vasodilators and aspirin for 3 months. At the affected digits, the digital/brachial index (DBI) is 0.5. Upper extremity angiography shows an occlusion of the ulnar artery within Guyon’s canal and distal vessel patency. What surgical option is most likely to alleviate symptoms and promote wound healing?",Ulnar artery recinstruction with interpositional graft,Thrombectomy and litigation of the ulnar artery,Surgical sympathectomy,"Digit salvage not possible, recommend finger amputation"
Hand,AAOS,,,108,A 75-year-old [woman] has persistent pain at the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint of their right thumb attributable to degenerative arthritis. Bracing and corticosteroid injections have provided only temporary relief. What is the best surgical option?,Arthrodesis in 15 to 20 degrees of flexion and slight pronation,Silicone arthroplasty,Surface replacement theory,Arthrodesis in 45 to 50 degrees of flexion and slight supination
Hand,AAOS,,,149,"A 9-year-old [boy] with spastic hemiplegia is evaluated for left upper extremity dysfunction. Evaluation of the left upper extremity reveals active elbow range of motion of 20° to 140°, active forearm rotation from 80° pronation to neutral supination, and active wrist motion 70° of flexion to 30° of extension. Passive motion in the forearm and wrist is full. What is the most appropriate surgical treatment to improve forearm rotation function?",Pronator teres rerouting,Pronator teres release,Biceps tendon lengthening,Flexor carpi ulnaris to wrist extensor transfer
Hand,AAOS,,,206,"A 67-year-old [male] comes to the clinic because they have had painless, insidious onset of palmar masses, a little finger metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint flexion contracture of 60°, and a proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint contracture of 50°. The patient says that their father had similar symptoms in his hands. Which treatment for this patient is most likely to lead to the lowest incidence of contracture recurrence at 5 years?",Partial fasciectomy,Collagenase injection,Needle aponeurotomy,Corticosteroid injections
Hand,AAOS,,,230,"A 65-year-old [female] comes to the office because they are unable to actively extend the left wrist and digits. Two years ago, they sustained a radial nerve injury at the mid humerus level from a fracture, and the fracture healed with immobilization alone. Which of the following treatment options is most likely to restore motor function of the wrist in this patient?",Tendon transfers,Neve exploration and neurolysis,Nerve exploration and autograft reconstruction,Nerve transfers from the median nerve to the radial nerve
Hand,AAOS,,,,"A 79-year-old [female] sustained a minimally displaced midshaft fracture of the ulna and has no other acute orthopaedic injuries. The patient says that they sustained the fracture after they fell from a standing height. Medical history includes no chronic disease conditions, and the patient does not take anticoagulant medications. Physical examination shows ecchymoses in varying stages of healing on the face and trunk. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial management?",Report the patient's case to Adult Protective Services,Order urine protein electrophoresis,Refer for bone marrow biopsy,Obtain a DEXA scan
Hand,Orthobullets,,,,"An 8-month-old [male] who has a 2-month history of a well-circumscribed mass in the palm, just proximal to the palmar digital crease of the index finger. The mass has not changed in size and does not seem to cause pain. An ultrasound shows a well circumscribed hypoechoic mass. What is the next best step in treatment?",Observation,Excisional biopsy,Ultrasound-guided aspiration,MRI of the hand for further characterization of the mass
Hand,AAOS,,,,"A 39-year-old [female] presents with a 10-week history of right proximal forearm pain and difficulty writing. The patient denies history of trauma. Physical examination demonstrates no active flexion at the thumb interphalangeal joint and index distal interphalangeal joint. The patient's sensory examination is normal in all distributions, and provocative maneuvers at the carpal tunnel are negative. Which diagnostic and treatment recommendation is most appropriate?","Electromyogram and nerve conduction studies, followed by observation","Laboratory studies for inflammatory arthropathy, followed by transfers for flexor tendon ruptures","Electromyogram and nerve conduction studies, followed by carpal tunnel release","Ultrasonography of cubital tunnel and Guyon’s canal, followed by surgical decompression"
Hand,AAOS,,,,A 55-year-old [female] underwent a volar plating of an extra-articular distal radius fracture 2 weeks ago. The patient is experiencing weakness with flexion of the interphalangeal (IP) thumb joint. IP joint flexion was normal before surgery. What is the best next step?,Observation,Immediate Exploration,Electromyogram/nerve conduction study (EMG/NCS),CT Scan
