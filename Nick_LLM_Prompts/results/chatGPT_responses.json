            "The most likely diagnosis is infraspinatus tendinitis or tear. The infraspinatus muscle is primarily responsible for external rotation of the shoulder. The symptoms described, such as moderate external rotation weakness and mild infraspinatus atrophy, suggest an issue with this muscle. The fact that the supraspinatus muscle appears to be functioning normally further supports this diagnosis."

The infraspinatus is one of the four rotator cuff muscles and is primarily responsible for external rotation of the shoulder. The symptoms described, including dull posterior shoulder pain, moderate external rotation weakness, and mild infraspinatus atrophy, are consistent with an injury to this muscle or its tendon."

            "The most likely diagnosis for this patient is infraspinatus tendonitis or tear. The infraspinatus muscle is a major controller of shoulder rotation, and its atrophy could explain the patient's weakness with external rotation. The normal supraspinatus function and the lack of sensory deficits further suggest a localized problem with the infraspinatus."

            "The most likely diagnosis is infraspinatus tendinitis or tear. The infraspinatus muscle is responsible for external rotation of the shoulder, and weakness in this motion combined with visible atrophy of the muscle strongly suggests a problem with this muscle or its tendon. The normal supraspinatus strength and sensation rule out a more generalized rotator cuff or nerve injury."

The infraspinatus muscle is part of the rotator cuff and is responsible for external rotation of the shoulder. The patient's symptoms, including weakness on external rotation and atrophy of the infraspinatus muscle, suggest an injury or condition affecting this muscle.
