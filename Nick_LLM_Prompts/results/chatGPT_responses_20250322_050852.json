This would explain the weakness in the IP joint of the thumb, as the median nerve is responsible for the flexion of this joint. A nerve conduction study would help diagnose the issue.

This condition is common after high tibial osteotomy (HTO) due to the change in biomechanics in the knee joint.

These ligaments are critical for maintaining the stability of the AC joint. The posterior instability suggests possible damage to the posterior capsule as well."
