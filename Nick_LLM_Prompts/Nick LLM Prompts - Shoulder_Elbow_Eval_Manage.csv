Shoulder and Elbow,AAOS,,Treatment,"A 45-year-old [woman] with diabetes has a 3-month history of atraumatic left shoulder pain and motion loss. The patient previously underwent treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication and a home stretching program, experiencing minimal relief of her symptoms. Examination reveals loss of passive external rotation, abduction, and forward elevation without reduction in strength. Radiographs are normal. What is the most appropriate next step?",Cortisone injection therapy with continued physical therapy (PT),MRI scan with and without contrast,Closed manipulation under anesthesia,Arthroscopic release with manipulation under anesthesia,
Shoulder and Elbow,AAOS,,Treatment,"A 42-year-old [woman] sustains a closed posterior elbow dislocation. A closed reduction is performed, and the elbow appears stable under fluoroscopic examination. Initial treatment should consist of",early mobilization only.,surgical reconstruction of medial and lateral collateral ligaments.,active motion in a hinged brace from 30° to 120°.,application of hinged external fixator with early mobilization.,
Shoulder and Elbow,AAOS,,Trearment,"A 72-year-old active [man] has shoulder pain after undergoing an explantation of an anatomic shoulder arthroplasty 6 months prior with an antibiotic cement spacer placed. The patient has 60° of forward flexion, 40° of external rotation, and a positive belly press with limited internal rotation. A recent work-up for continued infection is negative, and a follow-up MRI reveals grade 2 atrophy of the supraspinatus and grade 3 atrophy of the subscapularis with tendon retraction to the glenoid rim. What is the best next step in definitive management?",Reverse total shoulder arthroplasty,Revision anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty,Hemiarthroplasty with latissimus dorsi transfer,Resection arthoplasty,
Shoulder and Elbow,AAOS,,Treatment,"A 38-year-old [man] sustains a terrible triad injury consisting of an elbow dislocation, comminuted and displaced radial head fracture, and a type I coronoid fracture. Intraoperative findings after radial head replacement and lateral collateral ligament complex repair reveal persistent instability consisting of medial opening on valgus stress and posteromedial subluxation of the ulnohumeral and radiocapitellar joints. What is the best next step?",Medial collateral ligament repair or reconstruction,Reconstruction of the radial collateral ligament,Resection of the type I coronoid fracture and capsular repair to the remaining coronoid,Open reduction and buttress plating of the coronoid fracture,
Shoulder and Elbow,AAOS,,Treatment,"A 35-year-old [man] falls off of a roof and sustains an extra-articular supracondylar elbow fracture. The patient had normal sensation in all fingers after the injury and before undergoing surgery to repair the fracture. The ulnar nerve was not transposed but was inspected prior to wound closure. Ten days after surgery, the patient has numbness in his small finger and is unable to cross his fingers. Their elbow range of motion is 40° to 100°. What is the next appropriate step in management?",Continued observation,Exploration of ulnar nerve and transposition,Electromyography (EMG),Elbow splint at 40° for 6 weeks,
Shoulder and Elbow,Orthobullets,,,A 62-year-old [male] presents with a right anterior shoulder dislocation after slipping and falling down 2 stairs. The patient was successfully treated with a closed reduction and instructed to follow-up as an outpatient. Four weeks later he complains of persistent shoulder weakness and pain. What would be the most appropriate next step?,MRI right shoulder,Subacromial steroid injection,Physical therapy,EMG,
Shoulder and Elbow,Orthobullets,,,A 42-year-old [male] has a suspected distal biceps rupture with a tendon that can be palpated but is painful during the hook test examination. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?,MRI scan,Early physical therapy with emphasis on ROM and strengthening,Operative exploration of distal biceps tendon,Immobilizationi for three weeks followed by repeat physical examination,CT scan
Shoulder and Elbow,Orthobullets,,,A 16-year-old [] swimmer has pain and weakness in their dominant shoulder with overhead use. Their physical examination demonstrates a +2 anterior and posterior load and shift test. There is 1.5cm of sulcus sign evident with the arm at adduction and 30 degrees of external rotation. Their radiographs are normal. What is the most appropriate next step in management?,Dynamic stabilization therapy,Arthroscopic anterior and posterior labral repair,Arthroscopic anterior and posterior labral repair with rotator interval closure,Home stretching program with emphasis on posterior cpasular stretching,Sport specific bracing
Shoulder and Elbow,Orthobullets,,,"A 64-year-old [female] presents with persistent weakness after a left shoulder dislocation that occurred 6 weeks ago. The patient has attempted physical therapy, but their weakness has not improved. The patient reports pain that radiates into the left upper arm and occasionally the neck when they sleep at night. What would be the next step for this patient?",Left shoulder MRI,EMG,Cervical spine MRI,Glenohumeral corticosteroir injection,Physical therapy for pericapsular and rotator cuff strengthening
Shoulder and Elbow,Orthobullets,,,"A 47-year-old, healthy, active [] patient presents with a sub-acute, full-thickness supraspinatus tear. The patient's physical examination reveals significant weakness and pain with abduction. There was no glenohumeral instability. Radiographs demonstrate a type 1 acromion. An MRI scan shows a crescent shaped tear with 2-cm of tendinous retraction and no tendinous fatty changes. A subacromial corticosteroid injection 6 weeks ago provided them with 24 hours of pain relief but no improvement in strength. What would be the most appropriate treatment option?",Rotator cuff repair,Repeat subacromial corticosteroir injection,Biological augmentation of rotator cuff with porcine small intestine xenograft,Rotator cuff repair plus acromioplasty,"Rotator cuff repair, remplissage procedure, biceps tenodesis and distal clavical excision"
