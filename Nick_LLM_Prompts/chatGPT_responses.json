The MCL is responsible for providing stability to the inner side of the knee joint and preventing excessive valgus (outward) movement of the knee.

Postoperatively, the patient has decreased sensation about the posterior arm both above and below the elbow, but hand sensation is intact. What nerve was most likely injured?": [
            "The nerve most likely injured in this case is the radial nerve. The radial nerve innervates the posterior arm both above and below the elbow, and damage to this nerve can result in decreased sensation in these areas. The fact that hand sensation is intact suggests that the injury is likely located proximal to the branching of the radial nerve into the superficial radial nerve, which innervates the hand."

Their medical history reveals they had mononucleosis 1 month ago. What is the most likely explanation for these findings?": [
            "The most likely explanation for these findings is splenic rupture. The combination of left upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, tachycardia, and a recent history of mononucleosis is highly concerning for splenic rupture, especially in a young athlete who may have sustained trauma during a football game. Mononucleosis can lead to splenomegaly (enlargement of the spleen), making the spleen more susceptible to injury, which can result in splenic rupture"

Postsurgically, the patient reports improvement in their medial pain and resumes normal activities. About 9 months after their surgery, however, the patient reports burning pain in the front of their knee with running. The patient's examination reveals no joint line tenderness, mild pain with patellar compression, and limited patellar glides. What is the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms?": [

This condition is characterized by pain in the front of the knee, especially with activities such as running, jumping, or climbing stairs. The limited patellar glides and mild pain with patellar compression seen on examination are consistent with this diagnosis. Patellofemoral pain syndrome can occur as a result of altered biomechanics following a high tibial osteotomy, leading to increased stress on the patello"

Nonsurgical treatment consisting of anti-inflammatory medication, corticosteroid injections, and rest fails to alleviate their symptoms. The patient undergoes an arthroscopic distal clavicle resection with excision of the distal 8 mm of clavicle (Mumford procedure). Three months after surgery, the patient reports mild pain and popping by their clavicle. The patient's clavicle demonstrates mild posterior instability on examination without any obvious deformity on their radiographs. What structures were compromised during their excision?": [
            "During the Mumford procedure, the distal end of the clavicle is excised. This involves removal of the acromioclavicular ligaments and possibly part of the coracoclavicular ligaments. The excision of the distal clavicle can lead to instability of the acromioclavicular joint, which may result in the symptoms of mild pain and popping reported by the patient."
