Trauma,AAOS,,,"A 33-year-old [man] was injured in a motorcycle collision and sustained a T4 flexion distraction fracture, left open humerus fracture, and a right closed femur fracture. The patient is awake and follows commands but is unable to move his lower extremities. The patient's blood pressure is 75/40, heart rate is 45, and their blood pressure does not improve with administration of 2L of crystalloid. What is the most likely cause of his hemodynamic compromise?",Neurogenic shock,Hemothorax,Cardiac tamponade,Septic shock from small bowel rupture
Trauma,AAOS,,,"A 23-year-old [female] is brought to the emergency department after they fell from a height. Initial imaging shows a displaced fracture of the left acetabulum. The patient subsequently undergoes open reduction and internal fixation without complication. However, postoperatively the patient has difficulty with mobilization; repeat imaging shows widening of the sacroiliac joint. Based on this finding, what is the most likely acetabular fracture pattern?",Transverse,Posterior wall,Posterior wall and posterior column,Anterior column
Trauma,AAOS,,,A 34-year-old [] logger falls from a tree and sustains a diaphyseal tibia fracture with a dislocation of the proximal tibiofibular joint. What structure is most at risk in this injury pattern?,Common peroneal nerve,Popliteal artery,Tibial nerve,Anterior tibial artery
Trauma,AAOS,,,"A 24-year-old [male] sustained a severe hyperextension injury to their left knee while skiing. Radiographs obtained in the emergency department show a posterolateral knee dislocation. The patient undergoes closed reduction, and postreduction ankle-brachial indices are within normal limits. However, the patient says that he has numbness over the dorsum of the foot and over the first web space. Which nerve is most likely injured?",Common peroneal nerve,Deep peroneal ,Superficial peroneal ,Tibial
Trauma,AAOS,,,a 58-year old [male] with history of osteomyelitis of the left tibia has a painful ulceration of the anterior lower limb. A photograph of the wound demonstrates purulent discharge and an unpleasant odor. Radiographs of the left tibia demonstrate invasion of the tibia with osteolytic erosion. A biopsy reveals malignant degeneration. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Squamous cell carcinoma,Reticulosarcoma,Fibrosarcoma,Malignant fibrous histiocytoma
Trauma,AAOS,,,A 33-year old [female] sustained an open displaced and comminuted talus fracture with tibiotalar and subtalar dislocation after a motor vehicle collision. The development of osteonecrosis has been shown to correlate to what characteristic of this patient's injury?,Subtalar dislocation,Medial neck comminution,Open fracture type,Time to definitive surgical fixation
Trauma,AAOS,,,"An 18-year old [male] presents as a level one trauma after a motor vehicle collision and is found to have a displaces femoral neck fracture. If treatment is delayed beyond 24 hours, what complication is most likely to occur in this patient?",Nonunion,Avascular necrosis,Post-traumatic osteoarthritis,Infection
Trauma,AAOS,,,"A 29-year old [female] is involved in a high-speed motor vehicle collision and sustains a closed left posterior wall acetabular fracture. When determining appropriate treatment options for this patient, which of the following underlying factors is mostly likely associated with hip instability in this patient?",Cranial exit point of the fracture,Presence of acetabular retroversion,Fracture size <20% of the posterior wall,History of developmental dyplasia of the hip
Trauma,AAOS,,,A 27-year old [female] is brought to the emergency room after sustaining an isolated pelvic injury in a motorcycle collision. She also has an extraperitoneal bladder rupture that does not require repair by urology. A catheter is placed. Radiographs and CT scan demonstrate anterior and posterior pelvic ring injuries. The patient subsequently undergoes transsacral fixation as well as anterior pelvic fixation. What is the most common complication associated with the anterior fixation chosen for this patient?,Heterotopic ossification,Permnant femoral nerve ddysfunction,Wound breakdown,Loss of fracture reduction
Trauma,AAOS,,,A 53-year-old [male] is involved in a motor vehicle accident and sustains an unstable pelvic ring injury. Surgical fixation with anterior and posterior open reduction and internal fixation is performed. What is the strongest predictor of complication after surgical treatment of unstable pelvic ring injuries in this patient?  ,Injury pattern,Age of the patient,Timing of postoperative weight bearing,Patient compliance to postoperative activity restrictions
