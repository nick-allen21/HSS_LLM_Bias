Trauma,AAOS,,Treatment  ,"A 41-year-old [man] is involved in a high-speed motor vehicle crash and sustains a closed femoral midshaft fracture and a unilateral pulmonary contusion with a hemothorax, requiring placement of a chest tube. He has an initial blood pressure of 90/50 mm Hg. After receiving two liters of crystalloid, he has a blood pressure of 115/70 mm Hg and a heart rate of 90 bpm. He has normal mentation and does not require ventilator support. An arterial blood gas reveals that his delta base is -2 mmol/L. What is the most appropriate treatment for his femoral fracture?",Reamed intramedullary nailing,Skeletal traction,Unreamed intramedullary nailing,Open reduction and internal fixation,
Trauma,AAOS,,Treatment,"A 34-year-old [man] sustains a pelvic ring injury treated with a subcutaneous internal pelvic fixator for a symphyseal dislocation and an S1 transiliac-transsacral screw for a right zone 2 sacral fracture. Postoperatively, he is unable to extend his right knee and has numbness over the lateral aspect of his thigh. What is the best next step in management?",Removal/adjustment of internal pelvic fixator,CT scan to assess posterior fixation placement,Observation,MRI scan of the lumbar spine to assess for radiculopathy,
Trauma,AAOS,,Treatment,"An 18-year-old [man] is injured in a fall from 20 feet and sustains a closed, intra-articular left distal femoral fracture with extension to the mid-diaphysis. The patient has also sustained a splenic laceration and an intracranial hemorrhage. The patient is in the operating room for exploratory laparotomy and splenectomy. At the conclusion of the exploratory laparotomy their blood pressure is 105/70, heart rate is 130 without pressors, and intracranial pressure is 26 mmHg. Lactic acid is 5. What is the best next step in the orthopaedic care of this patient?",Placement of an external fixator and continued ICU resuscitation,Splinting of the left lower extremity and further resuscitation,Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) with a lateral locked plate,ORIF of the articular injury and intramedullary nailing,
Trauma,AAOS,,Treatment,A 48-year-old [man] presents with a left posterior wall acetabular fracture. A CT scan reveals a concentrically reduced hip with 18% of the posterior wall involved in the fracture fragment with 1 mm of cortical incongruity. What is the best next step?,Examination under anesthesia of the left hip,Closed nonoperative treatment,Open reduction and internal fixation,Closed percutaneous fixation,
Trauma,AAOS,,Treatment,A 27-year-old [woman] injures their leg at a trampoline park and sustains a knee fracture dislocation. The patient has extensor hallucis longus weakness and decreased sensation in the first dorsal web space. Ankle brachial index is 0.85.  posterior tibial pulse is weakly palpable. What is the next most appropriate step in treatment?,Sedation and closed reduction followed by reassessment of the vascular examination,Emergent revascularization and 4-compartment fasciotomies,Application of an external fixator followed by revascularization,Open reduction and internal fixation of the fracture followed by vascular shunting,
Trauma,AAOS,,Treatment,"A 34-year-old [man] sustains a pelvic ring injury treated with a subcutaneous internal pelvic fixator for a symphyseal dislocation and an S1 transiliac-transsacral screw for a right zone 2 sacral fracture. Postoperatively, he is unable to extend his right knee and has numbness over the lateral aspect of his thigh. What is the best next step in management?",Removal/adjustment of internal pelvic fixator,CT scan to assess posterior fixation placement,Observation,MRI scan of the lumbar spine to assess for radiculopathy,
Trauma,AAOS,,Treatment,A 24-year-old [male] presents to the emergency department after they sustained a low-velocity gunshot wound to the left hip. Physical examination shows no evidence of intra-abdominal organ or vascular injury. Radiographs show the bullet is lodged within the left iliac wing. The most appropriate next step in treatment is,administration of intravenous antibiotics.,emergent debridement of the left hip.,CT of the pelvis with intravenous contrast.,MRI of the pelvis without contrast.,
Trauma,AAOS,,Treatment,"A 24-year-old [woman] is injured in a motor vehicle collision and sustains a right posterior wall acetabular fracture and a left closed femoral shaft fracture. Her blood pressure is 138/75 and heart rate is 95. Her lactic acid is 1.9, and she is awake and conversant. It is now 11AM and an operating room is available if needed. What treatment strategy will decrease her risk for complications and shorten her hospital stay?",Intramedullary nail fixation of the femoral shaft fracture and open reduction and internal fixation of the acetabular fracture,Ongoing resuscitation until her lactate is <1.0,External fixation of her femoral shaft fracture and skeletal traction for her acetabular fracture,Delayed fixation of the fractures until hospital day 3,
Trauma,AAOS,,Treatment,"A 20-year-old [male] lacrosse player sustains a blow to the head during a game. The player lies on the field for 5 seconds before getting up and does not believe that they lost consciousness. The player initially had dizziness after standing up, but the symptoms resolved within 15 seconds. When evaluated on the sideline, their examination is normal. What is the best next step?","Remove athlete from the game, and initiate concussion protocol",Send athlete immediately to the emergency room for a CT of the head.,"Start a progression of simulated drills on the sideline; if no symptoms develop, return him to the game.",Allow athlete to return to the game without restriction.,
Trauma,AAOS,,Treatment,"A 25-year-old [male] sustains a femoral shaft fracture in a motor vehicle collision. Radiographs and an initial trauma CT scan show no evidence of a femoral neck fracture, but the patient has groin pain. The patient does not want to undergo an MRI scan because they have severe claustrophobia. What is the best next step?",Assess the soft tissue window of the CT scan,Treat the patient for an occult femoral neck fracture ,Sedate the patient and perform an MRI,Proceed without further workup ,
Trauma,AAOS,,Treatment,"A 75-year-old [female] with an extensive cardiac history and osteoporosis presents to the emergency department with complaints of left hip pain after a fall at their assisted living facility.
