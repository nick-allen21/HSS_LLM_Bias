Adult Reconstruction,AAOS,,,"A 41-year-old [female] with a history of arthritis presents to the clinic for evaluation of mild, intermittent pain in both knees with recent temporary swelling. The patient says they have pain in their hands, feet, and back with all activities and is worried that they will soon develop debilitating knee pain as well. During the interview, the patient says that they have been prescribed a topical medication by their dermatologist. Physical examination shows dactylitis and visible skin plaques. Radiographs show no notable degenerative changes of the knee. An MRI scan obtained by her primary care provider is most likely to show which of the following findings?",Synovitis,Meniscus tear,Anterior cruciate ligament,Avascular necrosis of the femoral condyle
Adult Reconstruction,AAOS,,,"A 52-year-old [man] with a BMI of 40 and primary osteoarthritis undergoes total hip arthroplasty through a posterolateral approach. To retract the femur anteriorly when exposing the acetabulum, the surgeon places a sharp curved retractor over (anterior to) the anterior inferior iliac spine. Pulsatile bleeding is encountered. A branch of which artery has been injured?",Femoral,Medial femoral circumflex,Obturator,Iliac cricumflex
Adult Reconstruction,AAOS,,,"A 52-year-old [woman] has right hip pain and obvious swelling 3 years after undergoing a resurfacing arthroplasty. The patient's implant consists of a 42-mm femoral component and 48-mm socket. The patient's components are well positioned, and their metal ion levels are slightly elevated (less than 4 ppm) with a normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) level. What is the most likely cause of their discomfort?",Pseudotumor from a local reaction to metal debris from the bearing surface,Chronic periprothetic infection,Impingement of the femoral neck on the edge of the cup,Referred pain from lumbar disk disease
Adult Reconstruction,AAOS,,,"An 82-year-old [female] sustains a periprosthetic femur fracture after a mechanical fall. Medical history includes an uncomplicated left total hip arthroplasty 5 years ago. The current fracture requires open reduction and internal fixation, revision of the femoral stem to a modular splined and tapered revision stem. What is the most common cause for subsequent reoperation in patients with this similar injury?",Periprosthestic jointg infection,Subsequent periprosthetic fracture,Aseptic loosening,Fracture nonunion
Adult Reconstruction,AAOS,,,"A [Patient] with varus knee alignment is undergoing a cruciate-retaining total knee arthroplasty. Once releases have been performed to achieve soft tissue balance, intraoperative valgus testing shows the following: 3+ opening in extension; 1+ opening in 90Â° of flexion; 1+ opening in mid flexion. What structure has been excessively released?",Posterior oblique ligament,Deep medial collateral ligament,Superficial MCL,Pes anserine tendons
Adult Reconstruction,Orthobullets,,,"A 71-year-old [male] presents with worsening right knee pain and decides to undergo a revision total knee arthroplasty. The patient previously underwent a revision 10 years ago. Prior to proceeding with surgery, the patient is informed that a tibial tubercle osteotomy may be needed. Which of the following is likely present?",Presence of a well-fixed tibial cone and cemnted stem,Patellar maltracking,Extensive metaphyseal bone loss,Elevated joint line
Adult Reconstruction,Orthobullets,,,"A 42-year-old [female] presents to your clinic with 1 year of hip pain. Upon chart review, you find that the patient had a total hip arthroplasty for hip dysplasia 5 years ago by an outside surgeon. The operative report states that a modular neck hip stem was used. On exam, the patient has a limb-length discrepancy but otherwise normal gait. On serum labs, erythrocyte sedimentation rate is 1.1 mm/h, C-Reactive Protein is 0.9 mg/L, Cobalt level is 6.1 ng/mL (normal <0.9 ng/mL), Chromium level is 2.3 ng/mL (normal <0.3 ng/mL). Radiographs show a stable modular neck hip stem implant without subsidence or surrounding lucency. MRI with metal-artifact reduction sequence (MARS) is performed and shows capsular thickening with intracapsular fluid. What is the most likely etiology of the patient's symptoms?",Micromotion at femoral head-neck or stem-neck junction,Electrochemical energy transfer between two dissimilar metals,Isolated histiocyte response to wear particles,Bacterial adherence to implabt surface with gltcocalyx formation
Adult Reconstruction,Orthobullets,,,"A 75-year-old [female] undergoes total knee arthroplasty (TKA) using a cruciate retaining implant with a highly cross-linked polyethylene insert. During the case, the femoral component is positioned against the lateral edge of the femoral cut and the center of the tibial tray sits medial to the medial 1/3 of the tibial tubercle. Total thickness of the patella with button is 22mm. Extension and flexion gaps are felt to be balanced intraoperatively. What is the most likely complication that will be seen in this patient?",Patellar maltracking,Osteolysis,Patellar fracture,Flexion instability
Adult Reconstruction,Orthobullets,,,"A 56-year-old [male] undergoes revision of his right hip arthroplasty for acute pain and radiographs suggestive of ceramic femoral head fracture. At the time of the revision, multiple fragments of the ceramic femoral head were seen in the joint and soft tissues. The components were noted to be in good position. The patient was copiously irrigated and the ceramic head was exchanged with a metallic femoral head. 12 months later, the patient presents with insidious onset right groin pain. Radiographs show no gross abnormalities without signs of loosening. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the patient's pain?",Massive third body wear,Periprosthetic infection,Pseudotumor formation,Soft tissue metallosis
Adult Reconstruction,Orthobullets,,,"A 57-year-old [man] with a history of chronic lower back pain and right hip arthritis is postoperative day 2 from an uncomplicated right total hip arthroplasty with a spinal block. Since the procedure, the patient has reported persistent pain in their right leg with a focal point in the proximal lateral leg. The patient has had difficulty getting out of bed for physical therapy due to pain reproduced in their leg. The patient is voiding but has not yet had a bowel movement. Physical exam is only significant for decreased ankle dorsiflexion strength on the right. Plantarflexion strength remains 5/5 bilaterally. No point tenderness was elicited and Homan's sign is negative. The patient's wound is unremarkable with typical post-operative swelling of the leg and no significant drainage. The patiebt has been receiving ASA 81mg PO daily since surgery and has been wearing compression stockings full-time. Postoperative repeat radiographs of the hip are unremarkable and the patient's hemoglobin is stable. Which of the following etiologies is most likely responsible for this patient's symptoms?",Lumbar lateral recess stenosis,Gluteal hematoma,Patient positioning,Acute post-operative infection
