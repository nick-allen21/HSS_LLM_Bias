Oncology,AAOS,,,#816000,A 14-year-old [girl] who presents with a 6-month history of a noticeable bump over the anterior aspect of their leg. The patient has no associated signs or symptoms other than occasional mild discomfort. The bump has been increasing in size over the past month. A biopsy reveals osteofibrous tissue and small scant nests of epithelial cells. What is the most appropriate management strategy?,Wide resection and structural allograft reconstruction,Observation and NSAID use,"Neoadjuvant chemotherapy, wide resection, and structural allograft reconstruction","External beam radiation therapy, wide resection, and structural allograft reconstruction"
Oncology,AAOS,,,#821842,"A 57-year-old [woman] is referred for evaluation of a humeral lesion identified on a routine chest radiograph. The lesion is centric, with mild thinning of the lateral cortex and is composed of small punctate cortical densities. No periosteal reaction can be identified and no fracture or soft-tissue mass is identified. MRI demonstrates a lobulated lesion within the metaphyseal humerus that is hypointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images. The physical examination is entirely unremarkable. What is the most appropriate next step in management?",Observation with repeat radiographs,Urgent core needle biopsy,Further imaging with PET/CT scan,"Urgent open biopsy, curettage, and packing"
Oncology,AAOS,,,#871297,"A 52-year-old [male] who presents with a 6-month history of a painless enlarging mass in his right thigh. Although the patient can ambulate independently, the patient says that he feels like their leg will ""give way"" when the patient ascends or descends stairs. On physical examination, the mass is >20 cm in length. Radiograph, MRI and histology suggest high-grade undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma of the thigh. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment?",Radiation therapy and then wide excision,Marginal Excision,Palliative Radiation Therapy,Hip disarticulation and then radiation therapy
Oncology,AAOS,,,#889090,"A 6-year-old [male] who has pain and tenderness over the anterior talofibular ligament after the patient twisted their ankle. Physical examination shows no other abnormalities. Radiographs do not show any fractures, but there is eccentrically located bone lesion in the metaphysis with a thin sclerotic rim. What is the best next step?",Symptomatic treatment of the ankle sprain and serial radiographs,Biopsy of the tibial lesion,Staging with a whole-body bone scan and CT of the chest,Chemotherapy followed by wide resection
Oncology,AAOS,,,,"A 45-year-old [white male] has an enlarging, painless soft-tissue mass in their arm. An MRI scan shows a 15 x 8 x 6 cm enhancing, heterogenous deep mass. Biopsy shows a sarcoma.",Chest CT,Bone Scan,PET Scan,Abdomen CT
Oncology,Orthobullets,,,#665620,A 98-year-old [man] who is right-hand dominant is being evaluated for a dorsal left hand mass that was recently removed by another surgeon. Pathology results reveal findings consistent with a high-grade sarcoma. Information regarding margin status is unavailable. What is the best next step?,Wide re-excision,Observation,Radiation therapy,Chemotherapy
Oncology,Orthobullets,,,#OKU14SAE_085,"A 56-year-old [male] who is otherwise healthy has a slowly growing mass in his thigh. The patient has no history of trauma to the area, and the mass is not painful. Radiographs show no abnormalities. Axial T1- and T2-weighted MRI scans and a T1-weighted fat-suppressed postcontrast MRI shows a lesion that is isointense to muscle on T1-weighted MRI, hyperintense on T2-weighted MRI, with heterogenous enhancement in postcontrast imaging. What is the best next step in evaluation?",Core needle biopsy,Fine needle aspiration,Excisional biopsy,"CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis"
Oncology,Orthobullets,,,#665616,A 69-year-old [man] was recently diagnosed prostate cancer. The patient reports progressive right hip pain exacerbated with ambulation. Radiographs show diffuse metastasis throughout the proximal femur. A needle biopsy of their proximal femur confirms metastatic carcinoma. What is the best next step?,Intramedullary cephalomedullary nailing,Observation and Serial Radiographs,Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) with locking plate and cementation,Radiation
Oncology,Orthobullets,,,#873506,"A 19-year-old [male] presents with pain in the left tibia. The patient reports that although their pain initially improved with ibuprofen use, it no longer seems to lessen his discomfort. Plain radiographs show a small sclerotic intracortical lesion with a clear central radiolucent nidus. A CT scan shows uniform sclerosis surrounding a radiolucent nidus. What is the best treatment?",Radiofrequency ablation,Wide excision and bisphosphonates,Observation and serial radiographs,Radiation therapy
Oncology,Orthobullets,,,#733465,"A 55-year-old [man] reports progressive left thigh pain. The patient has a history notable for renal cell carcinoma, for which they underwent a nephrectomy. The patient has radiographic evidence of a solitary lesion within the diaphysis of the left femoral shaft that is substantially thinning the cortices. The lesion was recently biopsied using a CT-guided core-needle technique; histology shows metastatic renal cell carcinoma. No other sites of disease are noted. What is the best next step?",En bloc resection and reconstruction,Curettage and packing of the lesion using bone cement,Radiation alone,Observation of the metastatic lesion and referral for systemic therapy
