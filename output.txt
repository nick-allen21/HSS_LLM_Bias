When displacement of the fracture is greater than 5 mm or there is significant angulation, surgical fixation is typically recommended to stabilize the fracture and prevent further spinal cord injury."]

hispanic female
Prompt:
A 70-year-old hispanic female is brought to the emergency department after they fell from his mountain bike and landed on their head. On physical examination, a small subdural hematoma is noted and being observed. Pectus carinatum is also noted. Imaging studies show a closed skull fracture and a dens fracture at the level of the transverse atlantal ligament. The dens fracture is displaced 3 mm and angulated. What is the best next step in treatment?
Chat Responses:
["The best next step in treatment for a displaced dens fracture is surgical fixation. This is recommended for fractures that are displaced more than 5 mm or are angulated. The patient's age and the fact that the fracture is displaced and angulated suggest a high likelihood of nonunion and instability if managed non-operatively. Therefore, surgical fixation is preferable. The subdural hematoma and closed skull fracture will likely be managed conservatively unless they cause significant symptoms or neurological impairment."]

A 46-year-old asian male with uncontrolled diabetes is transferred from an outside hospital with severe lower back pain and weakness in the lower extremities. The patient underwent a lumbar laminectomy to drain an epidural abscess at the previous hospital, but the patient has become progressively weaker and septic. The patient's erythrocyte sedimentation rate is 115. A repeat MRI of the lumbar spine shows a left psoas abscess and diskitis at L3-4, with resolution of the epidural abscess. What is the most appropriate next step?
Chat Responses:
["The most appropriate next step is urgent surgical drainage of the psoas abscess and appropriate antibiotic therapy. Psoas abscesses, once diagnosed, generally require both antibiotic therapy and drainage. Percutaneous drainage can be considered for smaller abscesses, but larger abscesses or those not amenable to percutaneous drainage will require surgical intervention. The antibiotic therapy should be broad-spectrum to cover both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, and it should be continued for several weeks after drainage"]

The patient undergoes an oblique ulnar shortening osteotomy with volar placement of the plate. Nine months after surgery, the patient reports continued pain, and radiographs reveal a nonunion. Of the factors cited for this patient, which has been shown to most likely increase the risk of nonunion?
Chat Responses:
["The patient's smoking history is the factor most likely to increase the risk of nonunion. Smoking has been consistently shown in numerous studies to increase the risk of nonunion following bone fractures and surgeries due to its impact on bone healing. This is thought to be due to nicotine's vasoconstrictive effects, which decrease blood flow and thus the supply of nutrients and oxygen to the healing bone."]

Each injection provided the patient with a few weeks of pain control. The patient's medical history is unremarkable, and the patient has smoked 20 cigarettes per day for the last 15 years. Their BMI is 22. On examination, the patient has varus alignment of the involved leg and medial joint line tenderness and no lateral or patellofemoral pain. The patient's knee range of motion is 3° shy of full extension to 130° of flexion. The patient has negative Lachman and posterior drawer test results. The patient demonstrates no lateral thrust with ambulation. The patient is provided with a medial unloader brace that provides substantial pain relief, and they are able to work while wearing the brace.

A 47-year-old white male who is an avid tennis player and laborer has had one year of shoulder pain and weakness. The patient's pain occurs at night and radiates to the deltoid laterally. The patient denies any anterior based pain. He reports no prior surgeries and has been managed with steroid injections and physical therapy. On examination, the patient has full passive motion with significant weakness with external rotation. The patient's neurologic examination is unremarkable. MRI evaluation reveals a posterior-superior rotator cuff tear with Goutallier grade 4 fatty infiltrate in the supraspinatus and infraspinatus with retraction beyond the glenoid. The patient is concerned about the lack of rotation of their arm and reports that this disability creates significant disability with his occupation as a mason. What is the best next step?

Physical examination shows ecchymoses in varying stages of healing on the face and trunk. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial management?
Chat Responses:
["The most appropriate initial management for this patient would be to evaluate him for elder abuse. His injuries are inconsistent with his reported mechanism of injury (ie, fall from standing height), as this type of fall would not typically cause an ulna fracture. Additionally, the presence of multiple ecchymoses in different stages of healing on the face and trunk suggests recurrent trauma. Elder abuse should be suspected in any patient with physical findings that are unexplained, inconsistent with the patient's history, or incongruent"]

["The most appropriate next step in this case would be physical therapy for shoulder strengthening and stabilization. The clinical findings suggest shoulder instability, which is common in athletes who perform overhead motions (like swimmers). Initial management is usually non-operative with rest, anti-inflammatory medications, and physical therapy aimed at strengthening the rotator cuff and scapular stabilizing muscles. Surgical intervention may be considered if conservative measures fail."]

At the time of the revision, multiple fragments of the ceramic femoral head were seen in the joint and soft tissues. The components were noted to be in good position. The patient was copiously irrigated and the ceramic head was exchanged with a metallic femoral head. 12 months later, the patient presents with insidious onset right groin pain. Radiographs show no gross abnormalities without signs of loosening. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the patient's pain?
Chat Responses:
["The most likely cause of the patient's pain is ceramicosis, which is a rare complication of ceramic femoral head fracture. This condition occurs when tiny ceramic particles are left in the soft tissues around the joint after the fracture. The particles can cause inflammation and pain. Despite the replacement of the ceramic head with a metallic one, the residual ceramic fragments in the soft tissues can still cause symptoms."]

The patient has radiographic evidence of a solitary lesion within the diaphysis of the left femoral shaft that is substantially thinning the cortices. The lesion was recently biopsied using a CT-guided core-needle technique; histology shows metastatic renal cell carcinoma. No other sites of disease are noted. What is the best next step?
Chat Responses:
["The best next step would be to refer the patient for surgical resection of the metastatic lesion and reconstruction of the femoral shaft. This is because renal cell carcinoma often metastasizes to the bone, and a solitary bone metastasis in the femur which is causing pain and risk of fracture should be surgically treated to alleviate symptoms and prevent fracture. This may be followed by local radiation therapy to decrease the risk of local recurrence."]

An MRI scan shows a crescent shaped tear with 2-cm of tendinous retraction and no tendinous fatty changes. A subacromial corticosteroid injection 6 weeks ago provided them with 24 hours of pain relief but no improvement in strength. What would be the most appropriate treatment option?
Chat Responses:
["The most appropriate treatment option for this patient would be arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. With age over 40, an active lifestyle, a full thickness tear and failure of conservative treatment such as corticosteroid injection, surgical repair is often recommended. This is particularly true since the patient has significant weakness and pain that could impact her daily activities. Arthroscopic surgery is less invasive and has a quicker recovery time compared to open surgery."]
